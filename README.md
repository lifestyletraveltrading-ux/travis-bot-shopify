Sounds good! We've made great progress today by:

Recovering the Travis Bot functionality
Identifying and fixing several issues
Improving the code with better error handling and context awareness
Tomorrow we can continue with:

Testing the fixes we implemented
Addressing any remaining issues
Enhancing Travis Bot with additional features if needed
The updated code should now correctly handle shipping information, return policy questions, empty collections, and maintain conversation context when opening from proactive messages.

Have a good evening, and I'll be ready to help you continue with Travis Bot tomorrow!
